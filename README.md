# Online-Proctoring-Face-Detection
A real-time face detection system designed for online proctoring exams. The system ensures that only one face is visible on the screen during the exam to prevent cheating. It uses OpenCV's deep learning models to detect and count faces, displaying the number of detected faces and highlighting them with bounding.
